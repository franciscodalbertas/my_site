## Formating my PhD thesis with R

I have formated my PhD thesis using two very helpfull R resources: the [thesisdown package](https://thesisdown.rbind.io/) and the [ufscdown](https://github.com/lfpdroubi/ufscdown) customization, which are both customizations of the [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package.

Although some parts of the thesis are in portuguese, the main chapters are all in english.
