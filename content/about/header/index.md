  Hello!

I am a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge [ International Institute for Sustainability-IIS]( https://www.iis-rio.org/en/), based in the UK. My main interest is to use data to sustain and design environmental policies. My work is focused in using landscape ecology concepts and spatial analysis combined with statistics. Check my [publications](/talk) and know more about what I have been doing.
