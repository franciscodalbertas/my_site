  Hello!

I am a Research Associate at [ University of Cambridge]( https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-francisco-dalbertas-gomes-de-carvalho), based in the UK. My main interest is to use science to inform conservation actions. My work is focused in using landscape ecology concepts and spatial analysis combined with statistics. Check my [publications](/talk) and know more about what I have been doing.
