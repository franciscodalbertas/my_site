  Hi, nice to meet you!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [ International Institute for Sustainability-IIS]( https://www.iis-rio.org/en/), based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My main interest is to use data to sustain and design environmental policies. My work is focused in using landscape ecology concepts and spatial analysis combined with statistics. Check my my [publications](/talk) and know more about what I have been doing.
